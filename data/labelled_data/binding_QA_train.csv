Our core algorithms for clustering, classification and batch based collaborative     filtering are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. However we do not restrict     contributions to Hadoop based implementations: Contributions that run on a single node or on a non-Hadoop     cluster are welcome as well. The core libraries are highly optimized to allow for good performance also for     non-distributed algorithms. Scalable to support your business case. Mahout is distributed under a commercially     friendly Apache Software license. Scalable community. The goal of Mahout is to build a vibrant, responsive,     diverse community to facilitate discussions not only on the project itself but also on potential use cases. Come     to the mailing lists to find out more. Currently Mahout supports mainly four use cases: Recommendation mining     takes users' behavior and from that tries to find items users might like. Clustering takes e.g. text documents     and groups them into groups of topically related documents. Classification learns from existing categorized     documents what documents of a specific category look like and is able to assign unlabelled documents to the     (hopefully) correct category. Frequent itemset mining takes a set of item groups (terms in a query session,     shopping cart content) and identifies, which individual items usually appear together.",What is the source library of this binding?,-1,False

For software synthesizers see the Haskell packages synthesizer-alsa, synthesizer-llvm, supercollider-midi, hsc3, YampaSynth or the C packages fluidsynth and Timidity.   Applications include: Remapping of channels, controller, instruments, keys, Keyboard splitting, Conversion from notes to controllers, Latch mode, Convert parallel chords to serial patterns, Automated change of MIDI controllers, Echo simulation.   It is intended that you write programs for MIDI stream manipulation. It is not intended to provide an executable program with all the functionality available in a custom programming interface.

123319,-1,,"Deprecated in favor of pipes  This library offers an abstraction similar in scope to iteratees/enumerators/enumeratees, but with different characteristics and naming conventions.   This package is a fork of the original pipes package by Gabriel Gonzalez. See https://github.com/pcapriotti/pipes-core/wiki/pipes-core-vs-pipes for a comparison between the two packages.   Differences with traditional iteratees:    Simpler semantics: There is only one data type (Pipe), two basic primitives (await and yield), and only one way to compose Pipes (>+>).  In fact, (>+>) is just convenient syntax for the composition operator in Category. Most pipes can be implemented just using the Monad instance and composition.    Different naming conventions: Enumeratees are called Pipes, Enumerators are Producers, and Iteratees are Consumers.  Producers and Consumers are just type synonyms for Pipes with either the input or output end closed.    Pipes form a Category: that means that composition is associative, and that there is an identity Pipe.    ""Vertical"" concatenation works on every 'Pipe': (>>), concatenates Pipes. Since everything is a Pipe, you can use it to concatenate Producers, Consumers, and even intermediate Pipe stages.  Vertical concatenation can be combined with composition to create elaborate combinators, without the need of executing pipes in ""passes"" or resuming partially executed pipes.   Check out Control.Pipe for a copious introduction (in the spirit of the iterIO library), and Control.Pipe.Combinators for some basic combinators and Pipe examples.
